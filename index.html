  <img src="https://unsplash.it/200/300?image=1011" alt="Heather Sosa"><p>Hi there! I'm Heather and I am a Denver-based web designer and a graphic designer with six years of experience. Currently, I am studying, through my alma mater University of Denver, to become a Full Stack Web Developer. My program is set to complete in October 2017. I will be seeking full-time employment at the end of my coding bootcamp in Web Development, with a little design thrown in on the side. My professional background includes six years experience in web design, graphic design and marketing communications.</p>

  <p>When I'm not up to my elbows in code or Photoshop, I enjoy spending time with my two daughters and my silly husband exploring the Denver-area.</p>
